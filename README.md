# devtools

This cookbook provides a number of recipes around the configuration of 
development tools, environments, and build systems that I use. It's meant for 
personal system configuration for things like trying out new languages or small 
projects that don't require a large setup.

The following recipes are available and are named according to what they 
install on the system:

- ada
- c_cpp
- erlang
- fortran
- go
- haskell
- java
- octave
- opengl_vulkan
- performance_analysis
- php
- ruby
- rust
